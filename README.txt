Bonjour Scott and Alex.

The raw user driving code is the aW6Raw.c file BUT THE FILE THAT YOU HAVE TO INSTALL ON THE 
ROBOT IS COMPETITIONCODE.C.

the competition code is fairly straightforward void autonomous() is the autonomus code and usercontrol is obviously usercontrol.

for the autonomous code, it should be pretty straight forward, the robot moves back at full speed for half a second. To load the autonomous, place a cube on the square, and the robot will just move away from it, scoring a point. make sure position the robot in such a way that i doesn't hit other robots.

THE SKYRISE BUILDER MOTOR MUST BE PLUGED INTO PORT 4
THE CUBE CLAW MUST BE PLUGGED INTO PORT 5

Reverse the motors if nessacary. 

sorry for the typos, SO TIRED
text me with questions, and I might be able to program (I'm supposed to be somewhere, but there is a high chance that I will have access to my laptop)

LET'S GET THE W
